"""The ``/scsim/registry`` payload — Part IX §9.6.

Pydantic is canonical: this module renders the policy catalog (all 21,
implemented + planned), each Params JSON Schema with units/ranges/defaults,
the pipeline schema, the KPI dictionary, and the entity variable dictionary
into one JSON document. The frontend renders forms from this ONLY (no
hard-coded policies); Zod/Supabase validators are code-generated from the
same schemas; the MkDocs catalog pages are generated from it too
(scripts/gen_docs.py) — so docs cannot drift from code (Docs CI gate).

    Python literal: §4 D90's weakest door, and the archived manual had already
    drifted from it (it carried a ``status`` column for all seven that the engine
    does not). §3 and blueprint §6.2 make this module the single source of truth

    out of a call site: the fact a consumer needs is "is there a callable that
    runs this cell", and Python answering that is stronger evidence than any
    scan of ``_run_battery(…, "ST-n", …)``. It is the module's PUBLIC name, so a
    consumer can also say WHERE the battery lives — it is a ``scsim`` library
