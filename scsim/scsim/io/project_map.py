"""Canonical SuReSuite-project → scsim Scenario mapper (single source of truth).

This module is the ONE place that turns a project's stored data (item masters +
logistics + merged policies + scenario settings) into an scsim ``Scenario``. It
is pure and Supabase-agnostic: callers (the Fly worker) fetch rows and populate
the typed :class:`ProjectData`; this module applies the documented reducers,
unit normalization, defaults, and emits a structured :class:`MappingWarning`
list so nothing is ever silently wrong.

The human-readable contract lives in ``docs/data-simulation-mapping.md`` — keep
the two in sync. Economics (material cost, product price, capacity, MOQ, …) come
from the item-master rows first; logistics/policy values are only fallbacks, and
every fallback is recorded as a warning.

    That separation was not the first draft's, and CI is what settled it. The

# ── Base data requirements (§8.1) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# The entity fields the always-on engine mechanics read, with the exact
# fallback chains this module applies. Policy-specific requirements live on
# each plugin (PolicyPlugin.data_requirements); these are the world-model
# inputs every run consumes regardless of the policy set. When §4.4 promotes
# the mechanics into named default policies (P-C.4, P-P.0, …), these entries
# migrate onto those plugins. Exported to the frontend/edge validators via
# registry_export.build_registry()["base_data_requirements"].

# ── §4 D90 · THE POLICY-BUNDLE KEYS, DECLARED ───────────────────────────────
#
# WP 6.1 traced every /policies grid field to the engine and found THREE doors:
# the registry's `data_requirements` (`table.column` the engine needs from the
# dataset), a policy's `params_schema` (80 declared parameters), and — for
# everything else — A QUOTED STRING IN THIS FILE.
#
# Door 3 is not a contract. It is a text scan over Python, it was the only proof
# those fields reach the engine at all, and `single-source` (I1) says a data fact
# is authored once somewhere a generator can read. §3's standing law — "the
# registry export is the single source of truth for policy schemas" — was true of
# the schemas that exist and silent about these.
#
# §4 D90 said the fix belongs here and deferred it on "it needs a session that can
# run Python", the same premise D94 and D106 were deferred on and which WP 6.2
# found false.
#
# WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. It is not a second copy of the mapping: the mapper
# below is still the only code that performs it, and this table makes no runtime
# decision. It declares WHICH POLICY PARAMETER OR ENTITY FIELD each bundle key
# feeds, so a reader outside Python can answer "does this grid cell reach the
# engine, and as what" without scanning for a dict read. `registry_export`
# publishes it and `resolutionChains` reads it as door 3 proper.
#
# `parity` is what keeps it from drifting into fiction: every key here must be
# READ by this module, and every bundle key this module reads must be here —
# `scsim/tests/test_registry_io.py` asserts both directions against the source.
#
# SIXTEEN KEYS: `type` and `safety_stock_days` are rendered by both
# the supplier and the plant stage, so the grid has more cells than keys; the
# four replenishment cells (Q, κ, s, S) joined when supplier-row overrides
# started reaching the engine as `inventory_control.material_overrides`.
# (`utilization_cap_pct` joined in WP 9.3 — it was on the test's `not_rendered`
# list, which is the list of keys that are NOT grid cells, while the arithmetic
# it performs is half of what the plant stage exists to show.)
#
# `shadowed_by` is OPTIONAL and names the entity field that, when present,
# makes this key's value unreachable. Two keys carry it and both name
# `products.production_capacity` (§4 D167) — which since WP 13.1 is present when
# the master OR the Plant-stage override of it carries a value.
#
# `customer` (PLAN.md §24 WP 14.2) is a Customer-stage row, `node:<customer>::<product>`.
# From WP 14.2 to WP 14.4 the seven production-family keys declared it too, because
# `_composite_patches` resolved ANY `node:<x>::<product>` key to the product, so a
# production patch on a Customer row reached the product. WP 14.4 closed that reach
# (`exclude=` the existing Customer rows) when its five FG keys would have had to
# declare the same false scope; the probe that found it is
# `test_declared_scopes_are_the_scopes_the_mapper_reads` (§16 · WP 14.2, WP 14.4).
#
# `scopes` is REQUIRED (§23 WP 13.4, §4 D204 b): WHERE the mapper reads the key —
# `default` (the project-wide policy), `supplier` (a Supplier-stage row,
# `node:<supplier>::<material>`), `plant` (a Plant-stage row,
# `node:<plant>::<product>`). A /policies cell whose stage is not in its key's
# scopes is stored and versioned and changes no result, and the grid badges it
# "not simulated" — the badge list is generated from this field, and
# `test_declared_scopes_are_the_scopes_the_mapper_reads` perturbs every key at
# every scope to prove each declaration true.
#
# `master`, `rows` and `domain` are OPTIONAL and travel together (§23 WP
# 13.1): `master` names the item-master column this key OVERRIDES, `rows` the
# /policies stage whose row keys the mapper reads it from, and `domain` the
# values it accepts (positive · nonnegative · fraction) — an override outside it
# is ignored with a warning and the master decides. `empty_default` (and, when it
# is not a number, `empty_note`) is what the engine uses when the override, the
# master and every derivation are empty — the grid shows exactly that rather than
# an invented 0 (§23 WP 13.4). Nine keys carry them, and
# the grid reads all three from the registry rather than restating them.

# resolves the same rule (`src/lib/policies/masterOverrides.ts`) so the value a
# cell shows is the value read here.
#
# The sources of every value are COUNTED and the counts go to the run log, one
# line per field, so a run states how many entities took the /policies value,
# how many the uploaded master, how many a lane-derived value, how many another
# derivation (a product's capacity from the plant grid's line rate) and how many

    ── WHAT THIS USED TO BE, AND WHY IT MATTERED (§4 D69) ────────────────────

        customers=[Customer(id=c, name=c) for c in sorted(customers)]

    The mapper never read the `customers` table. Every customer therefore
    arrived with the entity DEFAULTS — `segment="default"` and
    `priority_weight=1.0` — and two P-C.2 features were inert on every project:

      · `priority_weight` — `p_c2_customer_allocation` falls back to
        `Customer.priority_weight` when its `priority_weights` param does not
        name a customer, so the fallback was always 1.0 and the `priority`
        ordering could not order anything.
      · `segment` — worse, because it is silent in a second way. Every customer
        was in the segment `"default"`, so `sla_tiers`, which is keyed BY
        SEGMENT, matched nothing and every fill floor was 0.0. The engine
        already warned about this (`unknown_sla_segment` in P-C.2's
        feasibility), and the warning named the symptom while nothing named the
        cause: the segments it compared against were a constant.

    A user filling in a customer's priority or segment changed nothing, on every
    project, with no error. That is T1 — a displayed field that resolves to
    nothing — reaching all the way into the results.

    An id can legitimately have no row: the id set is the union of this table and
    the customer ids found on outbound arcs. Those keep the entity defaults, and
    say so, rather than being dropped.
