"""P-C.2 customer_allocation — IMPROVISATION, who do we disappoint first. ✅

Context: under scarcity the engine's product-level fulfillment (P-C.1,
PH-60) says HOW MUCH ships; this policy says WHO gets it. Each product's
weekly new-demand fulfillment is distributed across the customers that buy
it (``Network.customer_links`` shares, uniform when absent), and per-segment
service KPIs are reported so "protect strategic accounts" becomes a measured
outcome instead of a hope. Inert for single-customer networks.

Rules (weekly-bucket fidelity — within a bucket there is no arrival order,
so ``fcfs``, ``proportional``, and demand-basis ``fair_share`` coincide as a
pro-rata split; they stay separate enum values because they diverge if a
sub-weekly tick ever lands):

- ``fcfs`` / ``proportional`` / ``fair_share``: pro-rata to demand shares —
  every customer of a product gets the same fill rate.
- ``priority``: serve customers in descending priority weight
  (``priority_weights`` param, else ``Customer.priority_weight``); high
  priority fills completely before lower sees a unit.
- ``sla_tier``: two passes — first guarantee each segment's fill floor
  (``sla_tiers``: segment → floor %, scaled down pro-rata when supply
  cannot honor all floors), then distribute the remainder by priority.
- ``revenue_max`` (WP 14.3): serve the highest-priced row first — the row's
  own price (``row_price``, else the outbound row's unit price, else the
  product's).

PER ROW (WP 14.3, ADR 0002 decision 4 — one rule per project, priority /
price / service target per row). ``setup`` PUBLISHES the rule and the per-row
inputs on ``ctx.row_allocation`` (the P-C.6 publish-at-setup pattern), and
P-C.1 — the single writer of fulfillment and backlog — splits each product's
supply with them. A row's priority is ``row_priority`` → ``priority_weights``
→ ``Customer.priority_weight``; its service target is ``row_floor_pct`` →
``Customer.sla_fill_floor_pct`` → the segment's ``sla_tiers`` floor → 0. When
the rule needs a per-row input (``revenue_max``, a row priority, a row or
customer floor under ``sla_tier``) or a row carries its own backorder
settings, fulfillment runs per row and this policy's segment KPIs are summed
from P-C.1's rows, so the two cannot disagree; an implicit row (a product no
customer row names) belongs to no segment. Otherwise the split below runs as
before, read-only.

The split is value-weighted with the product's unit price, matching the
engine's value-based fill-rate convention. Since WP 14.0 the split itself is
``core/allocation.py::allocate_batched`` — the one allocation function per-row
fulfillment (WP 14.3) and the plan's shortfall split (WP 14.4) also call — with
one row per (product, customer); its outputs are the ones this module computed
inline before, pinned by ``tests/test_allocation.py``. Distribution does not alter
product-level physics (totals are conserved); its output is the per-segment
service view — the §7 interaction-8 path made observable.

KPIs (facet 7, via ``kpi_contribution``): ``fill_rate_segment_<segment>``
per customer segment and ``min_segment_fill_rate``, both over the analysis
window. Segments are capped at 10 by the entity contract, so the KPI
surface stays bounded regardless of customer count.
