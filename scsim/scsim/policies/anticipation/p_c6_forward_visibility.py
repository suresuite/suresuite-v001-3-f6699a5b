"""P-C.6 forward_visibility — ANTICIPATION, the committed forward order book. ✅

Context: §III-D.6. A customer commits future orders over a visibility
horizon τ*, so the focal plant can plan procurement against a known forward
schedule instead of a stationary mean — the WSC-2026 MTO assumption. The
world already realizes demand from a pre-drawn schedule (PH-10 mechanic);
this policy is the *information* lever that exposes the forward window to
the plant. Realized demand is unchanged: D_p[t] = D̃_p[t] whether or not
anyone is allowed to look ahead (G-RNG invariance).

Mechanics: ``setup`` publishes τ* as ``ctx.visibility_horizon`` (the
P-S.4 ``detection_lag_override`` pattern), so the week-0 warm start
already sees it; the PH-10 residency re-asserts it. Consumers read the
book through ``ctx.forward_material_demand`` — today that is P-P.1's
``basis="forward_visible"`` (§II.4), the customer/plant two-stage
contract: the customer owns τ* and the schedule, the plant only reads it.

Feasibility (§4.6 rule 1): τ* cannot exceed ``settings.visibility_horizon``
(the schedule is only drawn that far ahead); warns when no plant policy
reads the book (visibility nobody consumes is inert).
