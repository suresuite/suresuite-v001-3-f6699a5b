"""P-S.4 early_warning_failover — ANTICIPATION, detection-lag compression. ✅

Context: the scenario's ``settings.detection_lag_weeks`` is the world's
intrinsic disruption-start → firm-knows delay (PH-20). This policy models a
visibility investment (supplier monitoring, tier-1 signal sharing): while it
is enabled the firm detects events after ``detection_lag_weeks`` instead —
never later than the scenario's own lag — and pays ``monitoring_cost`` as a
standing charge whether or not anything ever fails. It makes "what is a week
of warning worth?" a first-class CRN experiment: same world, ± monitoring.

Mechanics: PH-20 serves firm knowledge on demand through
``ctx.events_visible()``; this policy sets ``ctx.detection_lag_override``,
so every reactive consumer (P-S.1 rerouting, P-T.2 expediting, P-P.5
overtime, crisis ``ModeStrip`` values) simply reacts earlier. The policy
performs no failover itself — rerouting stays P-S.1's job (the planned-era
``failover_threshold_weeks`` parameter duplicated P-S.1's
``coverage_threshold_weeks`` and was dropped at implementation).

Feasibility (§4.6 rule 1): warns when the scenario's lag is already ≤ the
monitored lag (the investment buys no earlier knowledge) and when no
knowledge consumer is enabled (earlier detection with nothing to react is
pure cost).
