# SureSuite Public API & Access Control — Design Plan

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Draft v0.1 — plan for exposing the simulation platform as programmatically-accessible software with a hardened access-control layer |
| **Date** | 2026-07-11 |
| **Altitude** | Platform capability design: a public, versioned HTTP API over the existing control plane, plus the authentication, authorization, quota, and audit machinery that makes it safe to expose |
| **Authority** | Governed by `docs/design/next-gen-platform-design.md`. This document proposes a **new capability and a new gap (G15)** the blueprint does not yet cover; §16 lists the exact blueprint edits to apply when this plan is adopted, per the "document and code move together" rule in `CLAUDE.md`. |
| **Non-goals** | SQL DDL, finished code, dated schedules, a public billing/pricing system, a GraphQL surface (REST first) |

## 0. Reading guide

This plan answers one question: **how does SureSuite become software other systems can drive through an API — without opening a hole an attacker can walk through?**

It is written in the blueprint's own idiom: *"X already exists as Y — we complete and generalize it."* Almost every mechanism the API needs is already in the repository in embryo — tenancy (`organizations` / `organization_members`), a rate-limit shape (`ai_budgets.rpm/rpd`), an audit pattern (`admin_audit_logs` + `log_admin_action`), a validated command schema (`sim-command`'s Zod `CommandSchema`), a validation gate (§8.2 of the blueprint), and a Redis substrate for token buckets (Upstash). The work is to **assemble these behind one authenticated, authorized, rate-limited gateway** — not to invent a parallel stack.

The governing constraint comes straight from the blueprint's AI-layer guardrail (§12), promoted here to an API-layer law:

> **Every API surface is a subset of the platform's existing, already-guarded operations. The API adds identity, authorization, quotas, and audit — it never adds a privileged path the UI does not already have.**

## 1. Goals and non-goals

### 1.1 Goals

An external caller (a customer's script, a partner system, a CI job, a notebook) can, with credentials it holds — never a shared browser key — do the following programmatically:

1. **Manage inputs** — create/list projects, upload or edit item-master & network data, freeze a `dataset_version` (§8.4 provenance).
2. **Configure policies** — read the policy catalog, read/write `policy_defaults`/`overrides`, snapshot an immutable `policy_version`.
3. **Run simulations & experiments** — dispatch a run/experiment against a saved policy version, poll or subscribe for status, cancel, add replications.
4. **Retrieve results** — fetch aggregate KPIs, per-replication rows, mapping/validation findings, and the validated-model-card status (§9.5).
5. **Do all of the above safely** — every call authenticated to a specific principal, authorized to a specific tenant/project, rate-limited, quota-bounded, input-validated, and audited.

### 1.2 Non-goals (v1)

- Replacing the browser app's custom `approved_users` login (the API gets its **own** credential type; the two coexist).
- A public network-optimization or surrogate-training API (those land as their engine capabilities land — Phases D/E of the blueprint; the API surface is designed to extend to them).
- Billing/metering-as-a-product. Usage is **measured and quota-enforced** from day one (§7, §11); monetizing it is out of scope.
- Multi-region / sub-100ms SLAs.

---

## 2. Where we are: the current access model (and why it cannot be the API)

An honest assessment, grounded in the code, because the security plan is only as good as this diagnosis.

### 2.1 How access works today

| Fact | Evidence | Consequence for an API |
|---|---|---|
| The frontend ships a **single hardcoded anon/publishable JWT** for all Supabase traffic | `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts:6` | This key is already public (it's in the shipped bundle). It identifies *the app*, not *a caller* — useless as an API credential. |
| Auth is a **custom flow**, not Supabase Auth: `authenticate_approved_user(email,password)` → identity kept in `localStorage` | `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx:49`, `:117` | There is no per-user JWT to verify server-side. An API cannot trust anything the client asserts about who it is. |
| User context for RLS is set by `set_current_user_context({user_id,email})` — a **client-supplied `user_id`** | `useAuth.tsx:70`; GUC `app.current_user_id` set in migration `20250820165722_…` | Safe-ish in a browser right after a password check; **fatal for an API** — a caller could set any `user_id`. Identity must be derived from a server-verified credential, never from the request body. |
| The dispatch edge function authorizes by **"does the project exist"**, using the **service role** | `supabase/functions/sim-command/index.ts:653-664` (and the comment at `:649-652`: *"access control lives in that RPC layer, not here"*) | Any holder of the anon key who knows/guesses a `project_id` can dispatch compute against it. There is **no per-caller tenancy check at the dispatch boundary.** |
| CORS is wide open | `sim-command/index.ts:24` (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) | Fine for a browser GET pattern; must be tightened and paired with real auth for a credentialed API. |
| No rate limiting or quota on the compute path | `sim-command` enqueues to Upstash unconditionally | Dispatch is expensive (Monte-Carlo on a Fly worker). Unbounded ⇒ trivial cost-amplification / DoS. |
| The validation gate **fails open** on read errors | `sim-command/index.ts:414-418` (`gate_skipped`) | Correct as an *internal* resilience choice, but the API boundary must **fail closed** on auth/authorization/quota — never let a security check's failure become an allow. |

### 2.2 The one-sentence conclusion

**Exposing today's control plane as an API — anon key + client-asserted identity + "project exists" authorization + no quotas — *is* the "getting hacked" scenario.** The API therefore needs its own identity (API keys), its own authorization (tenant/project scopes enforced at the edge), and its own quotas — layered *in front of* the existing operations, which stay unchanged.

### 2.3 What we can reuse (the good news)

The platform already contains the load-bearing pieces:

| Need | Existing asset | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Tenancy model | `organizations`, `organization_members`, `projects.organization_id` | `20260709000002_super_admin_phase1.sql` |
| Rate-limit shape | `ai_budgets` with `rpm`, `rpd`, `budget_usd`, per `scope∈{user,org,project}` | same migration, lines 182-194 |
| Audit pattern | `admin_audit_logs` + `log_admin_action()` (actor, action, before/after, ip, ua) | same migration, lines 239-274 |
| Usage rollup pattern | `ai_usage_logs` + `v_admin_user_usage` view | same migration, lines 206-304 |
| Validated input schema | Zod `CommandSchema` (project_id, kind, payload) | `sim-command/index.ts:36-51` |
| Pre-dispatch data gate | `runValidationGate` / required-data manifest (§8.1–8.2) | `_shared/validationGate.ts`, `_shared/grading.ts` |
| Token-bucket substrate | Upstash Redis (already the worker queue) | `sim-command/index.ts:55-66` |
| Admin surface to hang key management on | `src/pages/admin/*` (AdminUsers, AdminUsage, AdminAudit) | `src/pages/admin/` |
| Schema-generation doctrine | registry export → generated forms/validators/docs (§6.2) | `scsim/scsim/io/registry_export.py` |

The API is mostly **wiring these together**, which is why it can be shipped incrementally and safely.

---

## 3. Design principles

1. **The gateway is a thin, authenticated façade.** It authenticates, authorizes, rate-limits, validates, then **delegates to the exact same RPCs and `sim-command` logic the UI uses**. No business logic forks into the API. (Guardrail of §0.)
2. **Least privilege, end to end.** A key grants the narrowest scope that works; the gateway holds the service role, the caller never does; a read key can never write; a project-scoped key can never touch another project.
3. **Defense in depth.** Auth at the edge **and** tightened authorization RPCs in the DB **and** RLS as a backstop. A single-layer bypass must not be a full compromise.
4. **Fail closed at the boundary.** Auth, authorization, and quota failures **deny**. (Contrast the internal validation gate, which may fail open — that is a data-completeness check, not a security control.)
5. **Everything is auditable and attributable.** Every API request resolves to `(api_key_id, principal, org, project, scope)` and lands in an append-only log. Provenance (the three-hash triangle, §8.4) already makes *results* reproducible; the API makes *access* reproducible.
6. **Secrets are hashed, shown once, rotatable.** No recoverable secret is ever stored. Every credential can be revoked and expired.
7. **Generated, not hand-maintained, contracts.** Request/response schemas for policy-shaped payloads are generated from the registry export (§6.2), so the API cannot drift from the engine any more than the forms can.

---

## 4. Target architecture

One new versioned edge function, `api` (routes under `/v1/**`), is the **single public entry point**. It runs the same per-request pipeline for every route:

```
Request ──▶ [1 CORS/preflight]
        ──▶ [2 Authenticate]    resolve api_key from `Authorization: Bearer sk_…`; verify hash; check active/expiry
        ──▶ [3 Resolve principal] key → org, creator, scopes, allowed project_ids
        ──▶ [4 Authorize]       route+method needs scope S and project P ∈ key's tenancy? else 403
        ──▶ [5 Rate-limit]      Upstash token bucket per (key, window); quotas (concurrent runs, reps) ; else 429
        ──▶ [6 Validate]        Zod schema per route (+ registry-generated schema for policy payloads); else 400/422
        ──▶ [7 Delegate]        call existing RPC / sim-command logic with SERVICE ROLE, scoped to resolved tenant
        ──▶ [8 Audit + respond] append api_request_logs row; return typed JSON (+ Idempotency replay if applicable)
```

```

**Why a dedicated `api` function rather than exposing `sim-command` directly:**
- `sim-command` is optimized for a trusted first-party browser (anon key, `*` CORS, project-exists check). Bolting API auth onto it would entangle two very different trust models.
- A separate function lets the API have its **own** CORS policy, key-based auth, versioned routes (`/v1`), and stricter fail-closed posture, while it *reuses* `sim-command`'s dispatch **logic** (extracted into `_shared/dispatch.ts`) so there is still one code path to the worker.

**Recommended stack choice (with the alternative stated):** build the gateway as a **Supabase Edge Function**, consistent with every other server component in this repo (Deno + `_shared`). The alternative — a standalone API service (e.g. on Fly, next to the worker) — buys richer middleware and connection pooling but adds a deployment target, a second secrets surface, and network hops to Postgres. **Recommendation: start on edge functions; revisit a standalone gateway only if per-request latency or middleware needs force it** (§17 open question 1).

---

## 5. Authentication: API keys

### 5.1 Credential model

API keys are the v1 credential. They are **independent of the `approved_users` login** — issued to a principal (a user and/or an org), never derived from a browser session.

Key string format (shown to the caller **once**, at creation):

```
sk_live_<keyid8>_<secret32>      # live traffic
sk_test_<keyid8>_<secret32>      # sandbox / non-billable / rate-limited harder
```

- `keyid8` — a public, indexed prefix used to **look up** the row in O(1) without scanning.
- `secret32` — ≥256 bits of CSPRNG entropy. **Only a hash is stored** (SHA-256 of the secret is acceptable given the entropy; Argon2id if we ever allow low-entropy secrets). The plaintext is never persisted or logged.
- `sk_test_` keys are routed to a sandbox tenancy and can never dispatch large sweeps — safe for docs/examples.

### 5.2 `api_keys` table (concept)

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id`, `key_prefix` (unique, indexed) | identity + fast lookup |
| `secret_hash` | SHA-256/Argon2id of the secret; never the plaintext |
| `org_id` → organizations | tenancy anchor (required) |
| `created_by` → approved_users | who minted it |
| `scopes text[]` | e.g. `{read:runs, write:runs, read:data}` (§6.1) |
| `project_ids uuid[] NULL` | NULL = all projects in the org; non-NULL = restricted set |
| `env text` | `live` \| `test` |
| `status`, `expires_at`, `last_used_at`, `revoked_at`, `revoked_by` | lifecycle |
| `created_at`, `name`, `note` | management/UX |

RLS: only `current_is_super_admin()` or the key's `org` admins can read/manage rows for their org; **`secret_hash` is never exposed to any read path** (served through a view that omits it). Writes go through SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`create_api_key`, `revoke_api_key`, `rotate_api_key`) that return the plaintext exactly once, on creation, and log to `admin_audit_logs`.

### 5.3 Verification flow (gateway step 2)

1. Parse `Authorization: Bearer sk_…`; reject non-`sk_` immediately (401).
2. Split `key_prefix`; look up the row. Missing/revoked/expired ⇒ 401 (constant-time-ish: always hash before comparing to avoid a lookup-timing oracle).
3. Hash the presented secret; constant-time compare to `secret_hash`. Mismatch ⇒ 401.
4. Stamp `last_used_at` (async, best-effort — never block the request on it).

### 5.4 Lifecycle

- **Rotation:** `rotate_api_key` mints a new secret for the same scopes with an overlap window; old secret expires after N days. Clients rotate without downtime.
- **Revocation:** immediate (`revoked_at`), effective on the next request (and cache TTL ≤ 60s if the gateway caches key rows).
- **Expiry:** optional `expires_at`; expired keys 401 with a distinct `code` so clients can detect it.
- **Leak response:** revoke + rotate is a one-click admin action; `admin_audit_logs` shows every action taken with a leaked key.

### 5.5 Phase-2 option: short-lived tokens (OAuth2 client-credentials)

For partners who prefer not to send a long-lived secret on every call, add a `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint issuing short-lived (e.g. 15-min) signed JWTs from an API key. Keys stay the root credential; tokens reduce secret exposure on the wire. Deferred to Phase 4 (§14) — API keys cover v1.

---

## 6. Authorization: scopes and tenancy

Authentication says *who*; authorization says *what on whose data*. Both must pass.

### 6.1 Scopes (what)

Coarse, resource-plus-verb scopes — enough to enforce least privilege without over-engineering:

| Scope | Grants |
|---|---|
| `read:data` / `write:data` | read / edit projects, item masters, network, dataset versions |
| `read:policies` / `write:policies` | read catalog & configs / edit & snapshot policy versions |
| `read:runs` / `write:runs` | read runs & results / dispatch, cancel, add reps |
| `read:experiments` / `write:experiments` | (as the experimentation layer lands, §9 of blueprint) |
| `admin:keys` | mint/rotate/revoke keys (org-scoped; usually humans, not machines) |

A route declares the scope it requires; the gateway checks membership in the key's `scopes[]`. Missing scope ⇒ **403** (distinct from 401 missing/invalid key).

### 6.2 Tenancy (whose data) — the gap this closes

Every request that names a `project_id` (path or body) is checked:

```
project.organization_id == key.org_id
  AND (key.project_ids IS NULL OR project_id = ANY(key.project_ids))
```

This is enforced in the gateway **before** delegating, and re-checked in a new authorization RPC (`api_can_access_project(key_org, project_id)`) so the DB is not solely trusting the edge. **This is precisely the check `sim-command` does not do today** (§2.1) — the API closes it at its own boundary and hardens the shared dispatch path behind it.

Tenancy reuses `organizations` / `projects.organization_id` directly — no new tenancy concept.

### 6.3 Defense in depth

- **Edge:** scope + tenancy (above).
- **DB:** new `api_*` RPCs are SECURITY DEFINER but take the resolved `org_id` and re-verify project ownership; they never accept a caller-asserted user_id (the `set_current_user_context` anti-pattern is *not* reachable from the API path).
- **RLS backstop:** tables keep RLS on; the gateway's service-role delegation is deliberate and audited, not a blanket bypass — reads that *can* be expressed under RLS use the anon/authenticated role scoped to the resolved org where feasible.

---

## 7. Rate limiting, quotas, and abuse control

Compute is the expensive, abusable resource. Three cooperating limits, all reusing existing patterns.

### 7.1 Request-rate limits (per key)

- Token bucket in **Upstash Redis** (already present), keyed `ratelimit:{key_id}:{window}`. Sliding window: `rpm` and `rpd` per key, mirroring `ai_budgets.rpm/rpd`.
- Defaults by env: `sk_test_` far stricter than `sk_live_`.
- Over limit ⇒ **429** with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-{Limit,Remaining,Reset}` headers.

### 7.2 Compute quotas (per org/key) — the real DoS guard

Rate-limiting requests is not enough: one request can queue a 200-replication sweep. So the **write:runs** path additionally enforces:

| Quota | Enforced where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Max `replications` per run | clamp in dispatch (already `min(200,…)` at `sim-command:439`) | keep 200; make it a per-org ceiling |
| Max **concurrent** queued/running runs per org | count `simulation_runs` where status∈{queued,running} before enqueue | e.g. 5 (live), 1 (test) |
| Max runs per day / compute-seconds per month per org | `api_rate_limits` row (extends the `ai_budgets` shape) | tiered |
| Max experiment sweep size (cells) | validate before fan-out (when experiments API lands) | tiered |

Exceeding a compute quota ⇒ **429** (transient) or **402/403** (quota exhausted), with a machine-readable `code`.

### 7.3 Idempotency (correctness *and* cost control)

- `write:runs` accepts an `Idempotency-Key` header. The gateway stores `(key_id, idempotency_key) → run_id` for a TTL; a retry returns the **same** run instead of dispatching a duplicate. Safe retries, no double-charge.
- This dovetails with the blueprint's content-addressed **run cache** (§9.2): once `RunKey` caching lands, an idempotent submit of an identical `(graph,policy,scenario,seed)` can return cached results with **zero** compute — the API becomes the natural front door for "never simulate the same thing twice."

### 7.4 Input hardening

- Body size cap (e.g. 512 KB for config, larger only for bulk data upload endpoints which stream).
- Strict Zod per route; **`extra: forbid`-style rejection** of unknown fields (mirrors the engine's Pydantic `extra="forbid"`, A2).
- Policy-shaped payloads validated against the **registry-generated** schema (§6.2) — the API cannot accept a policy the engine can't run.
- The existing **required-data validation gate** (§8.2) runs on dispatch exactly as it does for the UI, but at the API boundary it **fails closed** for auth/quota while retaining the gate's own `block`/`warn` semantics for data completeness.

---

## 8. The endpoint surface (`/v1`)

REST resources that map 1:1 onto operations that already exist. Async operations (runs) return `202` + an id; results are polled or pushed (§9).

| Method & path | Scope | Delegates to (existing) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/projects` | read:data | `list_projects` RPC | org-scoped list |
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}` | read:data | project read RPC | tenancy-checked |
| `POST /v1/projects/{id}/datasets:freeze` | write:data | `snapshot_dataset` RPC | returns `dataset_version_id` + `graph_hash` (§8.4) |
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}/dataset-versions` | read:data | `list_dataset_versions` | provenance history |
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}/policy-catalog` | read:policies | registry export (`registry.generated.json`) | the honest catalog (A3) |
| `GET/PUT /v1/projects/{id}/policies` | read/write:policies | policy defaults/overrides RPCs (`20260609000025`) | registry-validated body |
| `POST /v1/projects/{id}/policy-versions` | write:policies | policy snapshot RPC (A5) | returns `policy_version_id` + `policy_hash` |
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}/scenarios` · `POST …/scenarios` | read/write:runs | scenarios table RPCs | horizon, disruptions, reps, seed |
| `POST /v1/projects/{id}/runs` | write:runs | shared dispatch (`sim-command` logic) | body = `{scenario_id, policy_version_id, acknowledge_warnings?}`; `Idempotency-Key`; → `202 {run_id}` |
| `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}` | read:runs | `simulation_runs` read | status, aggregates, hashes, `gate_skipped`, `model_validation_id` |
| `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}/replications` | read:runs | `run_replications` read | per-rep KPIs + weekly series |
| `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}:cancel` | write:runs | dispatch cancel path | |
| `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}:add-reps` | write:runs | dispatch add-reps path | |
| `GET /v1/runs/{run_id}/validation` | read:runs | `model_validations` / mapping report (§9.5) | credibility badge: validated/stale/unvalidated |
| `POST /v1/projects/{id}/experiments` *(Phase 4)* | write:experiments | experiment machinery (§9.1) | comparison / DOE / stress / portfolio |
| `POST /v1/webhooks` · `GET/DELETE …` | admin:keys | `api_webhooks` (§9) | signed callbacks |
| `GET /v1/keys` · `POST …` · `POST …:rotate/revoke` | admin:keys | key RPCs (§5.2) | secret shown once |

Conventions: cursor pagination (`5–10` items/page, matching the GitHub-MCP guidance the repo already follows), consistent error envelope `{error:{code,message,details}}`, ISO-8601 timestamps, and `X-Request-Id` echoed for support.

---

## 9. Async, webhooks, and realtime

Runs are asynchronous (the Fly worker is the sole result writer, A11). Three delivery options, cheapest first:

1. **Polling** — `GET /v1/runs/{id}` until `status ∈ {succeeded, failed, cancelled}`. Always available; document a backoff.
2. **Webhooks** — the caller registers an HTTPS URL; the platform POSTs `run.succeeded` / `run.failed` events, **HMAC-signed** with a per-endpoint secret (`X-SureSuite-Signature`), with retries + a replay-protection timestamp. A tiny `api-webhook-dispatch` worker (or a DB trigger on `simulation_runs` status change → enqueue) fans these out. Signing prevents forged callbacks; the secret is per-endpoint and rotatable.
3. **Realtime (advanced)** — issue a **short-lived, channel-scoped** Realtime token so a caller can subscribe to `sim:{project_id}` (the channel `sim-command` already broadcasts on). Never hand out the anon key for this — mint a scoped token.

---

## 10. Threat model & hardening — "to avoid being hacked"

The explicit answer to the user's second ask. Framed STRIDE-style, each row names the control and the existing asset it builds on.

| Threat | Vector against a naive API | Control in this design |
|---|---|---|
| **Spoofing** (pretend to be someone) | Reuse the public anon key; forge `user_id` via `set_current_user_context` | API keys with hashed secrets (§5); identity derived **only** from the verified key, never from the body; the `set_current_user_context` path is unreachable from `/v1` (§6.3) |
| **Tampering** (alter requests/callbacks) | Modify payloads in transit; forge webhooks | TLS everywhere; strict per-route validation; **HMAC-signed webhooks** (§9) |
| **Repudiation** ("wasn't me") | No record of who did what | `api_request_logs` (append-only) + `admin_audit_logs` for key lifecycle (§11); every result already reproducible via the three-hash triangle (§8.4) |
| **Information disclosure** (see others' data) | Guess a `project_id` and dispatch/read it (today's `sim-command` gap) | Tenancy check on every `project_id` (§6.2); service role held only by the gateway; `secret_hash` never in any read path; error messages don't leak existence (404 vs 403 chosen deliberately) |
| **Denial of service / cost amplification** | Flood dispatch; queue giant sweeps | Per-key rate limits + **compute quotas** (concurrent runs, reps, sweep cells) + idempotency (§7); Upstash token buckets |
| **Elevation of privilege** | Read key that can write; test key that hits prod scale | Least-privilege scopes (§6.1); `sk_test_` sandboxed & clamped; no scope ⇒ 403; keys can never assume the service role |
| **Secret sprawl** | Long-lived shared secrets, keys in logs | Show-once + hash-at-rest + rotation/expiry (§5.4); **redact `Authorization` and `sk_` patterns from all logs**; secrets via `cleanEnv` (existing hygiene, `_shared/env.ts`); optional short-lived tokens (§5.5) |

### 10.1 Cross-cutting hardening checklist

- **Rotate the service-role key** and confirm it is *never* shipped to any client; only the gateway (server-side) holds it. Consider rotating the anon key and scoping the browser app off any endpoint the API also fronts.
- **Lock CORS for `/v1`.** Credentialed API traffic should not use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Either require no CORS (server-to-server) or allowlist explicit dev origins; never combine `*` with credentials.
- **Fail closed** on auth/authorization/quota; **fail open only** for the *internal* data-completeness gate (and keep recording `gate_skipped`).
- **Constant-time** secret comparison; hash before compare even on prefix miss (no timing oracle).
- **Rate-limit unauthenticated 401s** by IP to blunt key-guessing / enumeration.
- **Dependency & secret hygiene:** pin edge deps; run the repo's `run_secret_scanning` before any key-handling code merges; add the `/security-review` skill to the API PR checklist.
- **PII & data governance:** decide what run outputs may cross the API boundary; redact where needed; document retention for `api_request_logs`.
- **Pre-launch:** a focused pen-test / red-team of the gateway (auth bypass, IDOR on `project_id`, quota bypass, webhook forgery) before `sk_live_` is offered externally.

---

## 11. Observability & audit

- **`api_request_logs`** (append-only, indexed on `created_at`, `api_key_id`, `org_id`) — one row per request: method, route, status, `project_id`, scope used, latency, bytes, `X-Request-Id`, truncated error code. Modeled on `ai_usage_logs` (§2.3).
- **`admin_audit_logs`** (exists) — key mint/rotate/revoke and webhook changes, via `log_admin_action()`.
- **Dashboards** — extend the admin surface (`src/pages/admin/AdminUsage.tsx`, `AdminAudit.tsx`) with per-key request/usage rollups, mirroring `v_admin_user_usage`. Owners see their keys' traffic; super-admins see all.
- **Alerting** — anomaly signals: 401 storms (key-guessing), a single key's rate spike, quota-exhaustion clusters, webhook failure rates. Wire to the existing notification path.

---

## 12. Developer experience

The API is only "software" if it's usable:

- **OpenAPI 3.1 spec**, versioned with `/v1`. Policy/scenario request bodies are **generated from the registry export** (§6.2) so the spec cannot drift from the engine — same CI-gate discipline as the docs (A13).
- **Reference docs** rendered from the spec (a new `docs/api/` tree or MkDocs page), with authenticated quickstarts.
- **Key management UI** in the admin dashboard: create (show-once), list, rotate, revoke, view usage — reusing the admin pages.
- **SDKs (Phase 3+):** thin TS and Python clients generated from the OpenAPI spec (Python especially — the analyst/notebook audience the blueprint calls out in §10.2 "For researchers/education").
- **Sandbox:** `sk_test_` keys + a seeded reference project so integrators can build without touching production data or burning compute.

## 13. Data-model additions (concept-level)

All follow the platform's established immutable/audit-log patterns (A5); no DDL here.

| Store | Keyed by | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `api_keys` | `key_prefix` | hashed secret, org, scopes, project restriction, lifecycle (§5.2) |
| `api_rate_limits` | `(scope, scope_id, period)` | rpm/rpd, concurrent-run cap, monthly compute budget (extends `ai_budgets`) |
| `api_request_logs` | `id` (+ time/key indexes) | per-request audit & usage (§11) |
| `api_webhooks` | `id` | endpoint URL, signing secret (hashed), event filter, status |
| `api_idempotency` | `(key_id, idempotency_key)` | `→ run_id`, TTL (§7.3) |

---

## 14. Rollout plan (phases with exit criteria)

Sequenced so the **security foundation ships before any write capability**, and read-only before dispatch.

**Phase 0 — Foundation & read-only spine.**
- `api` edge function skeleton with the full pipeline (§4), but only `GET /v1/projects` + `GET /v1/runs/{id}` wired.
- `api_keys` + `create/revoke/rotate` RPCs; show-once minting; `api_request_logs`; key-management UI in admin.
- Gateway holds service role; scope + tenancy checks live from day one.
- **Exit:** an external `sk_test_` key can list its org's projects and read a run, every call authenticated, tenancy-checked, and audited; another org's key gets 403; no anon key involved.

**Phase 1 — Read API GA + limits.**
- Remaining read endpoints (policies, dataset-versions, replications, validation status).
- Upstash token-bucket rate limiting; `X-RateLimit-*`/`Retry-After` headers; 401-by-IP throttle.
- OpenAPI spec + reference docs (read subset).
- **Exit:** documented, rate-limited, read-only API a partner can integrate against; dashboards show per-key usage.

**Phase 2 — Write & dispatch.**
- Extract `sim-command` dispatch into `_shared/dispatch.ts`; `POST /v1/…/runs` (+ cancel, add-reps) delegating to it.
- Compute quotas (concurrent runs, reps, daily cap) + `Idempotency-Key`; validation gate at the boundary, fail-closed auth.
- Policy/scenario write endpoints with registry-generated validation.
- **Exit:** an external caller can configure a policy version and dispatch a bounded run, with duplicate-submit protection and quota enforcement; abuse attempts are throttled/blocked and visible in logs.

**Phase 3 — Push & tooling.**
- HMAC-signed webhooks + realtime scoped tokens; TS/Python SDKs; sandbox reference project.
- Pre-launch pen-test of the gateway; secret-scanning + `/security-review` gates on the API code.
- **Exit:** `sk_live_` offered to first external integrators; end-to-end "submit → webhook → fetch results" works with signature verification.

**Phase 4 — Advanced surface.**
- OAuth2 client-credentials short-lived tokens (§5.5); experiment endpoints (§9.1) and, as they land, surrogate/criticality endpoints (§11 of blueprint); finer-grained per-endpoint quotas.
- **Exit:** the API tracks the experimentation and AI layers as they productize — same gateway, new scopes.

## 15. How this rides the existing roadmap

The API is **cross-cutting infrastructure**, not a single blueprint phase. Its natural anchor is the blueprint's **Phase C (experimentation productized)** — the API's headline value is programmatic runs/experiments and content-addressed reuse (§9.2), which Phase C delivers — but its **security foundation (Phases 0–1 above) can and should start earlier**, in parallel with Phase B, because it depends only on artifacts that already exist (tenancy, audit, dispatch, Upstash). The write/dispatch surface (Phase 2) should not GA until the validation gate and provenance triple are solid (blueprint Phases A/B0, already largely shipped), so that every API-dispatched run is as reproducible and validated as a UI-dispatched one.

---

## 16. Blueprint integration & traceability (edits to apply on adoption)

Per `CLAUDE.md` ("the document and the code move together; the blueprint is never allowed to go stale"), adopting this plan entails these edits to `docs/design/next-gen-platform-design.md`, made in the same PR as the first API code:

1. **Gap catalog (§2.3):** add **G15 — "No programmatic API or external access-control layer."** Evidence: `sim-command` authorizes by project-existence with the service role (`index.ts:653-664`); identity is client-asserted (`set_current_user_context`); a single hardcoded anon key fronts all traffic (`client.ts:6`). Consequence: the platform cannot be driven as software by external systems, and cannot be safely exposed as-is.
2. **Roadmap (§13):** add an **"API & Access Control"** workstream noting the foundation begins alongside Phase B and the dispatch surface GAs with Phase C; cross-reference this document.
3. **§12 guardrail:** extend the "every tool surface is a subset of the platform's existing public interfaces" law explicitly to the API (§0 of this doc restates it as API law).
4. **Gap index (Appendix C):** `G15 API & access control → this document, Phases 0–4`.
5. This document becomes a **companion design doc** (as `phase-b0-core-loop.md` is), referenced from §13.

Commit/PR trailer convention (per `CLAUDE.md`): e.g. `API Phase 0 / G15 / §12 guardrail: api-key gateway + tenancy check`.

## 17. Risks & open questions

| ID | Risk / question | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | **Edge function vs. standalone gateway service** | Start on edge functions (stack-consistent); revisit only if latency/middleware forces it (§4). |
| Q2 | **Adopt Supabase Auth for a real per-user JWT, or keep custom `approved_users`?** | The API sidesteps it with keys. Longer term, migrating the *browser* app to Supabase Auth would let RLS carry identity natively and shrink the service-role surface — worth a separate decision. |
| Q3 | **Key secret hashing: SHA-256 vs Argon2id** | SHA-256 is sufficient for ≥256-bit random secrets; require Argon2id only if we ever allow user-chosen secrets. |
| Q4 | **Rate-limit/quota tiers & pricing** | Enforce quotas from day one; the *values* per tier are a product decision, not a design blocker. |
| Q5 | **Result-data governance across the API boundary** | Define what run outputs may leave the tenant and the retention window for `api_request_logs` before `sk_live_` GA. |
| Q6 | **RunKey cache exposure** | Once §9.2 caching lands, decide whether cross-org cache hits are ever allowed (default: **no** — cache is org-scoped, mirroring surrogate validity scoping, §11.4). |
| R1 | **Service-role blast radius** — the gateway holds a very powerful key | Isolate it to the `api` function; never log it; rotate on schedule; the tenancy RPC re-checks so a gateway bug isn't automatically a data-crossing bug. |
| R2 | **Schema drift** between API contract and engine | Generate policy/scenario schemas from the registry export with a CI drift gate (§6.2 / A13). |

## Appendix A — Example: submit a run and fetch results

```http
POST /v1/projects/8f…/runs HTTP/1.1
Host: api.suresuite.app
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_1a2b3c4d_9f8e…       # the key's secret
Idempotency-Key: 3b1e-quarterly-stress-2026Q3
Content-Type: application/json

{ "scenario_id": "c2…", "policy_version_id": "a7…", "acknowledge_warnings": false }
```
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 58
{ "run_id": "r_5d…", "status": "queued", "policy_hash": "…", "graph_hash": "…" }
```
Then poll `GET /v1/runs/r_5d…` (or receive a signed `run.succeeded` webhook) and read `GET /v1/runs/r_5d…/replications`. A retry of the POST with the same `Idempotency-Key` returns `r_5d…` — never a second run.

## Appendix B — Pre-launch security checklist (condensed)

- [ ] Service role held only by the `api` function; rotated; never client-shipped; redacted from logs.
- [ ] `/v1` CORS locked (no `*`-with-credentials); 401s IP-throttled.
- [ ] Every `project_id` path/body value tenancy-checked at edge **and** in the authz RPC.
- [ ] Secrets hashed at rest, shown once, rotatable, expirable; constant-time compare.
- [ ] Rate limits + compute quotas + idempotency live on `write:runs` before GA.
- [ ] Webhooks HMAC-signed with per-endpoint rotatable secrets + replay protection.
- [ ] `run_secret_scanning` + `/security-review` clean on the gateway PR; pen-test booked before `sk_live_`.
- [ ] Auth/authorization/quota fail **closed**; only the data-completeness gate fails open (records `gate_skipped`).
