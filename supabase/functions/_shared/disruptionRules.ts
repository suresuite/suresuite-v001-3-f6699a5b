// The disruption-event rule, read from the engine and graded ONCE (WP 9.4 slice 6).
//
// `scsim/scsim/io/project_map.py::_map_events` is the only place a schedule becomes
// engine events. It keeps at most `event_cap` events, disrupts a supplier id of the
// project or the plant and skips every other target with a warning, rounds start and
// duration to weeks, and reads `magnitude_pct < 100` as a capacity cut BY that share.
// None of that was visible before a run: the Lab's editor offered free-text targets,
// the network pages offered any node, and the first a user heard of a skipped event
// was a mapping warning after the run had spent its compute.
//
// The numbers come from `registry.generated.json`'s `disruption` block — exported by
// `registry_export.disruption_rule()`, never restated here — and the caller passes
// that block in, so this module stays dependency-free and runs unchanged in Deno
// (`validationGate.ts`, the sim-command gate) and in the browser
// (`validationService.compileGateFindings`, the Lab's pre-run check, the event editor
// and the network pages' dialog). One rule, one wording, both sides of the dispatch.
//
// `engineTargetOf` mirrors the mapper's rule for ONE target. It is not a node-type
// classifier (oneClassifier.test.ts): it answers only "will the engine keep this
// event", by the engine's own test — a supplier id in the project, or the plant.
