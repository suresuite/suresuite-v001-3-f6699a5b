/**
 * PLAN.md §15 — the verification SQL, executed.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. §15 says "run against one project before Phase 0 and
 * after each phase; record counts in §16". It had never been run when Phase 2
 * closed, because no work-package session can open a database connection — the
 * egress proxy denies CONNECT — and §15 is written as a psql script nobody in
 * this repo is positioned to paste anywhere. So §15 sat as prose through two
 * phases while four decisions accumulated behind it (§16 PHASE BOUNDARY).
 *
 * The route is the one §16's WP 2.1 follow-up and `seed-project.yml` already
 * prove: CI holds `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and the Supabase Management API's
 * `/database/query` endpoint runs SQL against the live project. This script is
 * the §15 queries against that endpoint, and `verification-sql.yml` is the
 * dispatcher.
 *
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION, not by discipline. Every statement below is a
 * single `select`. There is no transaction to leave open, no DDL, and no
 * write path to get wrong — which matters because this is the one script in
 * the repo pointed at PRODUCTION DATA. `assertReadOnly()` refuses to send
 * anything whose first keyword is not `select` or `with`, so a later edit that
 * adds a write fails before it reaches the wire rather than after.
 *
 * WHAT IT PRINTS is counts and bounded samples, because counts are what §16
 * records and because a full dump of `material_id` spellings into a git branch
 * is a data export nobody asked for. Sample lists are capped at SAMPLE_CAP.
 *
 * Usage:  SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=… node scripts/data-contract/verification-sql.mjs [--project <uuid>] [--out report.md]

// not put a probe in the same push as a migration. That habit is satisfiable on a
// feature branch and **unsatisfiable at the merge**, which is where both workflows
// actually fire — `supabase-migrations.yml` is `branches: [main]` and this workflow
// has no branch filter at all, so a branch that touched a migration AND one of the
// three §15 doors fires both on its merge commit, at the same second, by
// construction. Run `35466205199` is that: the report is stamped 20:03:28 and the
// seven migrations applied at 20:04:11–13, in the middle of its 74 statements.
//
// So the instrument detects it instead of the author remembering. `max(version)` of
// the migration ledger is read BEFORE the first probe and again AFTER the last one.
// If it moved, the database changed underneath the report and every count in it is of
// an unknown shape — which is a GATE FAILURE, not a footnote, because a number nobody
// can date is the thing this whole file exists to replace.
//
// Each `### ` heading also carries an HTML-comment timestamp, so a raced report can
// still be read: the sections before the deploy are of the old shape and those after
// are of the new one, and the boundary is visible rather than guessed.

// `security_definer_view`, ERROR, EXTERNAL — and it is RIGHT that the view runs
// as its owner. That is the one declared exception to D38: `approved_users` is
// REVOKEd from `authenticated` (20250826015629), so `security_invoker = true`
// raises "permission denied" for every reader including the super admins whose
// two pages are its only consumers. `20260916000009` proved that by executing it.
//
// The exception is safe for exactly one reason: the view states its own
// authorization, `WHERE public.current_is_super_admin()`, the same predicate
// `ai_usage_logs`'s own policy enforces. Without that line an owner-run view
// hands every user's month-to-date AI SPEND to anyone who can select from it.
//
// WHAT WAS MISSING IS THE HALF §15 EXISTS FOR. `supabase/rehearsal/030` asserts
// both clauses — no seventh owner-view, and this one keeps its predicate — but
// against a database built from the migrations ON THE BRANCH. Nothing had ever
// asked PRODUCTION. The schema probe above compares relation NAMES, so a view
// that exists under the right name with the wrong `reloptions`, or one replaced
// from the SQL editor, is invisible to it. That is D45's lesson with a different
// object in it: WP 2.3 claimed the data-plane audit worked on the strength of a
// migration that landed, and §15 found zero rows. This is the same claim about
// views, made against the database the linter is actually looking at.

 * `no-orphan-table`'s lesson (§4 D43) is that production can differ from what the

 * these figures, and a plan sized from history is a plan sized from a guess.
 *
 * SELECT ONLY. `pg_policies`, `information_schema.role_table_grants` and `pg_roles`
 * are catalog reads; nothing here changes anything.
 *
 * WHAT A PREDICATE-LESS POLICY IS, precisely, because the whole stage turns on it:
 * `qual` is the USING clause and `with_check` is the WITH CHECK clause. A policy with
 * neither, or with one that is literally `true`, permits every row for every caller
 * holding the table grant. That is not "permissive RLS" in the PostgreSQL sense of
 * `AS PERMISSIVE` — it is RLS that refuses nothing.

// ── WP 4.3: the two T3 tables nothing has counted, and the before-figures ──

//
//  1. `supply_chain_data` and `supply_chain_data_multi_tier` row counts. They
//     are the two ETL outputs in the contract, they are the tier-3 tables that
//     GAIN `computed_from_hash` here, and WP 5.3 needs today's figure as its
//     own before-number. WP 4.1's probes did not touch them and WP 4.2's four
//     derived tables are a different set — so "how many derived rows carry no
//     input hash" has only ever been answered for the network group.
//
//  2. `analysis_runs` BY KIND. WP 4.2 shipped with the count at zero and said
//     so in three places. This package is the first real caller, so the
//     after-run is the first time a non-zero count means anything at all — and
//     it means ANALYZERS RAN, never adoption (§16 · WP 4.2 · N).
//
//  3. `network_nodes.uid`'s NULLABILITY, read from production rather than from
//     the migration. D72's row asserts `uid` is NULLABLE and the creating
//     migration says `uid text NOT NULL`; D43's whole class is production
//     disagreeing with the migrations, so the only way to know which is true of
//     the database the index will be created on is to ask it.
//

 * §15 · D175 follow-up — WHERE does each project's notion of "a material" live?
 *
 * D175 closed the Supplier stage's visibility gap by appending two row classes
 * (BOM intermediates, master-only materials) to the lane rows. What the fix
 * still cannot list is a material that exists ONLY in `bom_single_level` —
 * `useStageRows` reads the multi-level shape only (its line-80 guard), and a
 * single-level-only id that is also absent from `materials` has no source left.
 * A user report (2026-09-24, project `Test_Simulation`: "2 materials, 1 shown")
 * is either that shape, a not-yet-loaded frontend build, or an id that is a
 * PRODUCT to the model. Only production can say which, so this reads it —
 * every project, per §4 D42, with a per-id breakdown where the id count is
 * small enough to print.

/**
 * §15 · BOM usability, Phase 1 — WHAT SHAPE ARE THE MULTI-LEVEL BOMS WE HAVE?
 *
 * Before the Supplier stage's BOM tree (§4 D177) is redesigned, the design has
 * to be sized against the real uploads, not the fixtures: how deep, how wide,
 * how many materials sit under several parents, which sub-assemblies carry
 * their own inbound lanes, how many rows are orphans or root rows, and whether
 * the numbers the tree shows (the derived deep lane) agree with the numbers the
 * engine actually runs (`datamap._flatten_multi_level_bom`). D178 and D179 were
 * both lost by trusting a count, so this prints SHAPES and bounded samples per
 * project, and cross-checks the two sources of "how much M does one P need".
 *
 * EVERY project holding `bom_multi_level` rows is measured (§4 D42). Read-only.
 * Vocabulary, from the upload only (no second classifier — D127):
 *   edge         a row with a non-blank `higher_level_component_id`
 *   top parent   a parent that is nobody's child — the ENGINE's roots
 *   demanded     a product with outbound volume — the DERIVATION's roots
 *   leaf         a child that is nobody's parent — the engine's purchased set
 *   intermediate a child that is also a parent — a sub-assembly

// ── WP 8.0: the graph layer, measured BEFORE anything is changed ───────────
//
// WHY THIS PROBE EXISTS, and it is the whole of WP 8.0. The diagnosis of the
// Process- and Product-level network pages BRANCHES on a number nothing in this
// repository knows: how deep the BOM of the project a user is looking at is.
//
// `ProcessLevelNetwork.tsx`'s classifier is a fixed ladder — level 5 means
// supplier, 2–4 mean material, 1 means "work station" — and the ETL writes
// `supply_chain_data_multi_tier.level` as BOM TREE DEPTH on the bom lane and as
// that depth PLUS ONE on the inbound lane (§4 D112). So the ladder is correct on
// exactly one shape of data: a BOM four levels deep. On any other shape every
// supplier lands at a level the ladder calls a material, and the page renders
// and LABELS it as one. Whether that is what a given user is seeing, or a latent
// defect on their project and something else on their screen, is a fact about
// production and not about the code — so it is measured here first.
//
// Six questions, each one sized rather than described:
//
//   1. `projects.bom_level` for EVERY project. `single` writes no multi-tier
//      rows at all (D115), so a Process page that is empty needs no further
//      explanation, and one that is full rules the defect out.
//   2. the `level` histogram per lane. `max(level) = 5` means the ladder
//      happens to be right; anything else means D112 is live.
//   3. `to_location = ''` in the multi-tier table — D114, the severed BOM root,
//      as a row count.
//   4. one node id at more than one `level` — the blast radius of D113, the
//      dedup guard that tests a key it never writes.
//   5. one node id in more than one lane ROLE — D116, the firm that is both a
//      supplier and a customer and collapses into one node.
//   6. `node_list` against the multi-tier node set — how much of the graph the
//      typed projection WP 8.1 extends cannot currently see.
//
// Every one is a `select`. None of them needs the project §15 measures, because
// D42's lesson is that the largest project is the seeded one: all six run across
// every project in the database and print per-project rows.

//
// THE FIRST SEVEN PROBES ANSWERED A QUESTION THAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG ONE,
// and the report is what said so. Run 35433237514 read the `level` histogram and
// two projects with the SAME 396-row, 4-deep `bom_multi_level` disagreed about
// their own lane: one held bom levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 as the ETL's `row.level || 1`
// would write them, and the other held **397 bom rows all at level 2**, with its
// inbound lane split across levels 1 and 5.
//
// No reading of `combine-project/index.ts` can produce that, because a second
// ETL exists. `combine_project_into_supply_chain` is a SQL RPC called from three
// client sites, it writes BOTH edge tables, and it writes `level` by a fourth
// rule that is nothing like the edge function's: outbound `0`, `bom_single_level`
// a literal `1`, **`bom_multi_level` a literal `2` — ignoring `b.level`
// entirely** — and inbound `GREATEST(1, max_level + 1)` per material. That is
// D140, and it is the ninth classifier of the eight D127 counts, one layer down:
// two live writers disagreeing about what the column MEANS, where D127 is eight
// live readers disagreeing about what it SAYS.
//
// It also changes D129 from "an edge is dropped" to something worse. The RPC
// writes `COALESCE(b.higher_level_component_id, 'ROOT')` — so where the BOM root
// has no parent it does not drop the edge, it **invents a node called `ROOT`** and
// points every root material at it. The first seven probes found zero empty
// endpoints and read that as D129 being latent. It is not latent; it is a
// different shape, and a count of `''` could never have seen it.
//
// So: four more probes, all `select`, all every-project. Which writer wrote each
// lane (probe 8), whether `ROOT` is in the data (probe 9), whether the lane still
// agrees with the tables it was derived from (probe 10), and how many BOM roots
// there are for the defect to act on (probe 11).

// ── THE 2026-09-22 USER AUDIT — WP 1: the shape, measured before anything moves ──
//
// The audit (F-01…F-37) was written against the REPOSITORY, and said so: no
// browser, no database, no worker. Five of its findings cannot be sized and three
// cannot be designed until production answers the questions below — which engine
// actually runs (F-18), how many stored runs carry the fabricated 1.0 baseline and
// the censored TTR sentinel (F-03/F-04/F-05), whether `holding_cost_pct` is a
// fraction everywhere (F-21), whether any upload ever landed (F-01), and whether
// `node_list.echelon` is in production (F-09). Every probe is every-project (D42)
// and each is a `tryQ`, so a column the audit guessed wrong reports as a failure
// line rather than killing the run.
//
// ONE PROBE IS NOT SQL. F-16 turns on whether an UNDEPLOYED function is absent or
// a stale build is live, and SQL cannot see edge functions. The Management API's
// `GET /v1/projects/{ref}/functions` can, with the token this script already holds.
// It is a GET — read-only by the verb, as `assertReadOnly` makes the SQL read-only
// by the keyword — and `apiGet` refuses to be anything else.

// ── WP 6.5 (a) — THE LANDING SWITCH, measured either side of it ────────────
//
// Publishing `ingest-file` (§4 D123) switches every CSV upload in production onto
// the WP 3.2–3.4 landing path at once, and PLAN.md's 6.5a sequence asks for a read
// BEFORE and a read AFTER, over every project (D42). This section is both: the same
// probes, run once before the merge that publishes the function and once in a push
// AFTER it (never on the merge commit itself — D153).
//
// Four questions, each of which a rehearsal cannot answer:
//
//   (1) THE PRECONDITION (D156), positively. 0.9 above asks "which keys still point
//       at `auth.users`" and passes when `ingest_runs` is absent from the answer. That
//       is necessary and not sufficient: a migration that DROPPED the keys without
//       re-adding them would pass it too. So this reads the actor columns' keys by
//       TARGET, and fails the run unless both `ingest_runs` actor columns and
//       `ingest_files.uploaded_by` key to `approved_users`.
//   (2) THE BUCKET. `ingest-file` writes the bytes to storage bucket `ingest` BEFORE it
//       opens a run. The migration that creates it (`20260916000014`) is guarded on
//       `to_regclass('storage.buckets')`, so a database with no storage schema skips it
//       silently — and every rehearsal database is one. Only production can say.
//   (3) THE BASELINE, per project and per landable table: rows, rows carrying
//       `ingest_run_id`, rows carrying `source_row_id`; and `ingest_runs`,
//       `ingest_files`, `ingest_staged_rows` per project. The after-read is compared
//       against this, and "no table lost rows" is a claim about THIS table.
//   (4) THE EXIT, once there is anything to read: a tier-2 row whose `source_row_id`
//       resolves through `ingest_value_chain` — called as the function, with the run's
//       own promoter as the reader, because the exit names that function and a join
//       that imitates it would prove the imitation.
const LANDABLE = [
  // The ten the contract describes (`INGEST_DATASETS`), which land through `ingest-file`.
  "inbound_logistics", "outbound_logistics", "bom_single_level", "bom_multi_level",
  "materials", "products", "suppliers", "customers", "tier2_suppliers", "tier3_suppliers",
];
// Uploaded through the wizard but NOT landed — `ingest-file` only PARSES them (mode
