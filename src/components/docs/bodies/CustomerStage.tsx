          Each customer and product row carries its own demand — mode (forecast or model),
          distribution, mean, variation and, for a triangular row, its bounds, with the uploaded
          forecast beside them — and its own fulfilment: whether it backorders, for how long and at
          what cost, and the priority, price or service target the project's allocation rule reads.
          The supplier stage has {supplierCols} columns and the plant stage {plantCols}; this one
          has {cols.length}.

        <Key>
          One allocation rule per project; everything that rule reads, and every backorder setting,
          per row.
        </Key>
        <P>
          The <strong>allocation rule</strong> — priority, fair share, proportional, revenue
          maximising or SLA tiers — is set once, on the <Term>Customer allocation</Term> card at{" "}
          <AppLink to="/policies">/policies</AppLink>. Allocating between customers is a rule the
          chain applies <em>across</em> rows, so a per-row version would be several rules competing
          to be the rule; the engine reads one.
        </P>
        <P>
          What that rule reads is per row: a row's <strong>priority</strong>, its{" "}
          <strong>price</strong> and its <strong>service target</strong>. Each column appears only
          under the rule that reads it. So is <strong>backorder</strong>: one row can wait for supply
          while another of the same product loses what cannot be shipped, each with its own backlog,
          window and cost. When supply falls short, each product's units are split across its rows
          by the project's rule, a row's oldest backlog first. A project that sets none of this per
          row runs exactly as before, with the card's settings for every row.
        </P>
        <P>
          The base under these cells is your data: the{" "}
          <DocLink to="outbound-logistics">Outbound Logistics</DocLink> row (demand, price) and the
          customer's own row in the customers upload (priority weight, segment, contracted floor).
          An edit here is an override on the row; the upload is never changed.
