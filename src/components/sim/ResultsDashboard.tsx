          `ReplicationSeedExplorer` offers. So it rendered "Run a simulation that

          sentence that reads as something a different run could fix. A panel that
          can only ever be empty is a placeholder, not a state, and removing it is
          a smaller change than emitting a series no policy needs. The run-level
          measure exists and now renders in the table above, as
          `capacity_utilization`, which the same defect had been hiding.

          AND THAT LAST SENTENCE WAS FALSE FOR THE WHOLE OF ITS LIFE — §4 D167.
          `capacity_utilization` read `trace.Q`, which exists only under
          `full_debug`, so on every ordinary run it was NaN, the bridge mapped
          NaN to null, and the row never appeared in the table this comment
          points at. It is computed from always-on weekly series now, and
          `CapacityOverTime` above is the panel this comment judged not worth
