// The /policies page, column by column: what each cell shows, where an edit is
// saved, what the simulation engine actually uses, and whether an edit changes
// a run. Rendered on the Data map view (`PolicyColumnCheck.tsx`).
//
// WHERE EACH FACT COMES FROM, so this file is not a second author of any:
//   - WHICH columns exist, their header label and sub-label: read from
//     `STAGE_TABLE_SPEC` / `COLUMN_FIT` / `shortLabelFor` — the grid's own spec.
//     `policyColumnCheck.test.ts` fails when a column is added to (or removed
//     from) the spec without its verdict here, so the page cannot go stale by
//     omission.
//   - WHAT the engine does with each field: `scsim/scsim/io/project_map.py`
//     (`_map_policies`, the product / material / arc loops). The verdicts below
//     restate that reader in words; the test pins the one mechanical part of it
//     (a column may only claim to reach the engine if it is master-backed or in
//     `SCSIM_VISIBLE_FIELDS`).
//   - The production counts: PLAN.md §15, audit 2026-09-29, run `36629798467`,
//     every project. They are dated because they are measurements, not rules.
//   - Each open problem cites its PLAN.md §4 D-row, which owns the evidence.
