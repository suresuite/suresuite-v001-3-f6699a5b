/**
 * Chat PERSONAS — the five entries in the picker.
 *
 * These are not the routed agents. A persona is a system-prompt preamble and
 * nothing else: all five share one tool surface, one model and one prompt
 * body, and the only behavioural difference is a sentence like "Prefer the
 * risk and criticality tools first" (see the server mirror,
 * supabase/functions/project-ai-chat/agents.ts).
 *
 * The specialist agents — data-steward, policy-configurator, vv-analyst,
 * experiment-designer, report-builder, cost-estimator, network-cartographer,
 * disruption-sentinel — each have their own prompt, least-privilege tool
 * subset and proposal artifact, and are selected by the §6 router from what
 * the user asks, never from this picker. Nothing here maps onto them.
